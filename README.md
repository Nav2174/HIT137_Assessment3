**Question 1**
##Overview

This is a simple Translation Application built using Tkinter for the GUI and googletrans library to perform language translations. The application allows users to select source and target languages, input text in the source language, and view the translated result in the target language.
##Features

    User-friendly interface with a dark theme.
    Dropdown selection for both source and target languages.
    Text input box for entering text to be translated.
    Displays translated text in a separate text box.
    Alerts in case of empty input or translation errors.

##Requirements
###Dependencies

    Python 3.x
    Tkinter (built-in with Python)
    googletrans==4.0.0-rc1

###Installation

To run this application, you need to install the googletrans package. You can install it using pip:


```pip install googletrans==4.0.0-rc1```

###Usage

    Clone or download this repository.
    Ensure you have all the required dependencies installed.
    Run the Python file using:



```python Q1-TranslationScriptApp.py```

    The application window will appear with the following elements:
        Source Language Dropdown: Select the language of the input text.
        Target Language Dropdown: Select the language to translate the text into.
        Text Input Box: Enter the text you want to translate.
        Translate Button: Click to perform the translation and display the result.

###Application Layout

    Source Language: A dropdown to select the language of the text you want to translate.
    Target Language: A dropdown to select the language you want the text to be translated into.
    Source Text Box: Enter the text to be translated here.
    Target Text Box: The translated text will be displayed here.
    Translate Button: Click this button to perform the translation.

Example Usage

    Select "English" as the Source Language and "Spanish" as the Target Language.
    Type some text (e.g., "Hello World!") in the Source Text Box.
    Click the Translate Button.
    The translated text (e.g., "Â¡Hola Mundo!") will appear in the Target Text Box.

Error Handling

    If no text is entered in the input box, an error message will prompt the user to enter text.
    If any error occurs during translation (e.g., connectivity issues), an error dialog will display the issue.

###Customization

    You can change the default languages by modifying the self.src_lang_combo.set("English") and self.tgt_lang_combo.set("Spanish") in the create_widgets() function.
